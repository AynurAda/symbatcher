2025-08-02 23:53:30,034 - ComplexAnalysis - DEBUG - Analysis successful for text 'The product works as expected, nothing special....': The sentiment of this text is neutral. The statement does not express any strong positive or negative emotions. The phrase "works as expected" suggests that the product is meeting the basic requirements or standards, which is neither particularly exciting nor disappointing. Additionally, "nothing special" indicates a lack of extraordinary features or performance but does not imply dissatisfaction. Overall, the text reflects a neutral stance as it simply states the functionality without any emotional undertone.
2025-08-02 23:53:30,034 - ComplexAnalysis - DEBUG - Analysis successful for text 'Incredible innovation! This changes everything!...': The sentiment of the text "Incredible innovation! This changes everything!" is positive. 

Explanation: The use of the word "incredible" suggests something extremely impressive or extraordinary, which carries a positive connotation. Additionally, the phrase "This changes everything!" indicates a significant and presumably beneficial impact, further emphasizing a positive sentiment. The excitement and enthusiasm conveyed through the exclamation marks also contribute to the overall positive tone of the text.
2025-08-02 23:53:33,925 - ComplexAnalysis - DEBUG - Analysis successful for text 'I regret buying this, complete waste of money....': The sentiment of the text "I regret buying this, complete waste of money" is negative. This is because the word "regret" indicates a feeling of disappointment or dissatisfaction with a decision, and the phrase "complete waste of money" suggests that the purchase did not provide any value or fulfillment. Both expressions convey a strong sense of dissatisfaction and negativity towards the purchase, which contributes to the overall negative sentiment of the text.
